Describe your findings, and give your explanation of the performance of the different representations.

The accuracy varies everytime the compare_representations.m is run due to the randomization.
The pyramid representation accuracy was 0.5633, at level_0 representation accuracy was 0.60 and at level_1 representation accuracy was at 0.5750.
The accuracy differs because level_1 has more sift descriptors but they contribute negativily to its accuracy, hence the lower accuracy.
Meanwhile level_0 has better accuracy, despite being more limited in the amount of sift desciptors it contains, has a high accuracy.
This can be attributed to the fact that those specific descriptors matter more than others that may be found.
The pyramid representation is the worst since it combines the level_0 and level_1 sift descriptors.

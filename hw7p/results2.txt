Explain what you see in your plot (using the full range of k values), and explain the trends on the training and test sets you see as k increases

As the K values increase, KNN Test Accuracy starts at a high amount of acccuracy and then overtime drops slightly.
Meanwhile KNN Train Accuracy,starts at a very low accuracy and increases steadily and levels off.
Both SVM Test Accuracy and SVM Train Accuracy remain constant.

<h2>CS1674: Homework 9 - Programming</h2>
<b>Due:</b> 4/12/2018, 11:59pm 
<br><br>

This assignment is worth 50 points.
<br><br>

In this assignment, you will use a deep network to perform categorization. In order to simplify the problem, you will not <i>train</i> 
a deep net. Instead, you will use a common practice of simply using a 
pre-trained network to extract features. You will then use these features to 
train an SVM classifier which discriminates between the 10 scene categories used in HW7P.<br><br>

You will use the Caffe package, a very popular deep learning framework for 
computer vision. Caffe is a C++ framework, but has both Python and Matlab 
interfaces. In this assignment, we will only use the Matlab interface.&nbsp; 
We have installed Caffe for you on the <strong>class4.cs.pitt.edu</strong> 
server.<br><br>

Submit all code you write in a single script <font face="courier new">solution.m</font>.
<br><br>

<ol>
<u>Setup:</u><br><br>
<li>You will be connecting to the server via SSH. If you are using a Windows 
machine and haven't used SSH before, you will need to first download a SSH 
client such as PuTTY. You can download PuTTY from
<a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html">here</a>. 
If you are using a Mac or Linux, you already have ssh installed. </li>
<li>
                If you are off campus and don't have the VPN installed, you will
                need to first connect to Pitt's server and then ssh over to
                the class4 server. If you are on a Mac or Linux, open
                a terminal and type:
                <font face="courier new">ssh USERNAME@unixs.cis.pitt.edu</font>
                (where USERNAME is your Pitt username) and press enter to connect to the
                server. If you are on Windows, open PuTTY; for the host name,
                enter <font face="courier new">unixs.cis.pitt.edu</font>, then click Open to connect to the server. You will need
                to enter your Pitt username and password when prompted by the
                server. Once you are connected to that server, you can then type: <font face="courier new">ssh
                class4.cs.pitt.edu</font> and press enter to connect to the class4 server. If you
                are on campus, or have the VPN installed, you should
                be able to connect to the class4 server directly.
</li>
	<li>Once you are logged in, you will be taken to your AFS home directory and 
	will probably see a &quot;public&quot; and &quot;private&quot; directory (if you have not 
	changed these yourself). Make sure to put any assignment files you are 
	working on in the private directory (or another directory which no one 
	except you can access). </li>
	<li>You can either write your Matlab assignment file on your own computer 
	and transfer it to the server using scp (on Mac or Linux) or WinSCP (you'll 
	need to download this on Windows) to run it on the server, or directly write 
	the Matlab assignment file on the server using a text editor. 
	On Mac or Linux an scp command to copy a file you've written to the server 
	might look like this (where my username is clt29): <font face="courier new">scp 
	your_matlab_assignment_file.m clt29@class4.cs.pitt.edu:/afs/pitt.edu/home/c/l/clt29/private/&nbsp;</font> 
	This command will copy the Matlab file from your computer to your AFS 
	storage space. If you are on Windows and install WinSCP, you will be 
	presented with a GUI interface where you can drag and drop files from your 
	computer to your AFS space.</li>
	<li>Caffe requires libraries to be visible to Matlab for it to work. We need 
	to tell Matlab where these libraries are located. Before starting matlab, 
	type the following directly into the bash shell on the server:  
	<font face="courier new">export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/u/caffe/helper_tools/lib:/u/caffe/build/lib:/opt/cuda-7.5/lib64:/usr/local/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH</font> </li>
	<li>To launch Matlab on the server, type <font face="courier new">matlab -nodisplay</font>. 
	We include the <font face="courier new">-nodisplay</font> so that Matlab does not attempt to open the GUI 
	interface. You can then begin typing commands as you normally would in 
	Matlab or run a script that you write.</li>
	<li>Matlab needs to know where to find its interface to the Caffe library. 
	The Matlab <font face="courier new">addpath</font> command allows you to specify the location of files your 
	scripts need to run. Add the following line to the top of your script: 
	<font face="courier new">addpath('/u/caffe/matlab/')</font></li>
	
	
	<br><u>Loading the model and data, extracting features:</u><br><br>
	<li>We will now load in a pretrained CNN model. The model we are loading has 
	been trained on 1.4M images to classify each into 1000 classes.
<!--	(which aren't necessarily the objects we will be classfying). -->
	Add the following 
	line to your script:<br><font face="courier new">net = caffe.Net('/u/caffe/hw_cs1674/models/deploy.prototxt', 
	'/u/caffe/hw_cs1674/models/alexnet.caffemodel', 'test');</font> <br> The caffe.Net 
	function loads a network model for use in Matlab. The first argument 
	specifies a file containing the network structure which tells Caffe how the 
	various network layers connect. The second argument specifies the learned 
	model weights to load, and copies 
	them into the network structure created by the first argument.&nbsp; 
	The final argument tells Caffe to load the network in test mode, rather than 
	train mode. You will see a lot of output appear once you execute this 
	command which you can ignore.</li>
	<li>It is standard practice to subtract the mean of the train 
	data from each image before feeding the image to the CNN. Load the mean image of 
	the train data by using the following command:<br>
	<font face="courier new">image_mean = caffe.io.read_mean('/u/caffe/hw_cs1674/models/mean227.binaryproto');</font></li>
	<li>The data for this assignment is located at <font face="courier new">/u/caffe/hw_cs1674/data/scenes_lazebnik/</font>. 
	You will find 10 folders with scene category names. Each folder contains 
	60 images of the scene specified. You can use the Matlab 
	<font face="courier new">imageSet</font> function with the 'recursive' parameter to obtain a list of folders 
	and all images in them for easy processing. Note this function is part of the Computer Vision Toolbox. Alternatively, you can any useful parts from <font face="courier new">load_split_dataset.m</font> from HW7P.</li>
<li>	The name of the folder is the 
	image's ground truth label. For each image, you will need to extract two 
	feature types from the CNN, 'fc6' and 'fc7', and store them in a variable. Later, you will train a 
	linear SVM on each of the feature types.</li>
	<li>In order to extract the features for an image, first load the image in 
	Matlab using the <font face="courier new">caffe.io.load_image('PATH')</font> function, where <font face="courier new">PATH</font> is the path to the image you want to pass through the network. 
	Do not use Matlab's <font face="courier new">imread</font> function. Caffe expects images in BGR 
	format (instead of RGB), needs to have the width and height dimensions 
	flipped, and needs to be in single precision. The <font face="courier new">load_image</font> function will 
	do all of these things for you automatically. Because we are using black and white images, we need to convert to color using <font face="courier new">cat(3, im, im, im)</font>. After this conversion, use 
	Matlab's <font face="courier new">imresize</font> function to resize the 
	image to height and width 227 (which is what this model expects). After 
	resizing the image, subtract the <font face="courier new">image_mean</font> 
	we loaded previously from the image. You can then run the image through the 
	neural network by using the command <font face="courier new">net.forward({im});</font></li>
	<li>Once the image has been run through the neural network, we are ready to 
	extract features from the network. You will be extracting features from two of the three fully connected layers of the network, 'fc7' and 'fc6'. To extract 
	an image feature from the network, use the command<br>
	<font face="courier new">net.blobs(feature_name).get_data();</font><br>
	Store the features you extract somewhere, so you can use them to train the SVM.</li>
	
	
	<br><u>Training and testing the SVM:</u><br><br>
	
	<li>Use the same number of train/test images as for HW7P, i.e. 30 images from each of 10 classes to train, and 30 images from each class to test. Randomly sample the 30 images for training from the 60 images avaialble for each class. Use the remaining 30 images per class for testing.</li>
	<li>Train 2 linear SVMs using Matlab's <font face="courier new">fitcecoc</font> 
	function. <!--To specify that Matlab should train linear SVMs, pass the 
	following <font face="courier new">templateSVM</font> to the <font face="courier new">fitceoc</font> function. Matlab will also automatically standardize your train and test data for you.<br>
	<font face="courier new">
	templateSVM('Standardize',1,'KernelFunction','linear');</font> -->
	</li>
	<li>Test each of your SVMs on the test set and report the accuracy, in a file <font face="courier new">accuracies.txt</font>. Add a brief sentence in the text file saying how the performance of these features compares to the performance you obtained in HW7P with SIFT BOW and SIFT SPM.
	<!--Also 
	include a confusion matrix for each of the feature types using the
	<span class="auto-style1">confusionmat</span> function and include it in 
	your submission. What do you observe about the types of errors the network 
	makes? Enter your answer in a new text file <font face="courier new">observations.txt</font>.-->
